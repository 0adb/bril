# Speculative Execution

This extension lets Bril programs use a form of explicit [speculative execution][spec] with rollback.

In general, *speculation* is when programs perform work that might not actually be necessary or even correct, under the assumption that it is *likely* to be right and useful.
If this assumption turns out to be wrong, speculation typically needs some *rollback* mechanism to undo incorrect side effects and recover to a correct state.

In this Bril extension, programs can explicitly enter a *speculative mode*, where variable assignments are temporary.
Then, they can either abort or commit those assignments, discarding them or making them permanent.


Operations
----------

* `speculate`: Enter a speculative execution context. No arguments.
* `commit`: End the current speculative context, committing the current speculative state as the "real" state. No arguments.
* `guard`: Check a condition and possibly abort the current speculative context. One argument, the Boolean condition, and one label, to which control is transferred on abort. If the condition is true, this is a no-op. If the condition is false, speculation aborts: the program state rolls back to the state at the corresponding `speculate` instruction, execution jumps to the specified label.

Speculation can be nested, in which case aborting or committing a child context returns execution to the parent context.
Aborting speculation rolls back normal variable assignments, but it does not affect the [memory extension][mem]'s heapâ€”any changes there remain.
It is an error to commit or abort outside of speculation.
It is not an error to perform side effects like `print` during speculation, but it is probably a bad idea.


Interpreter
-----------

The [reference interpreter][interp] supports speculative execution.
However, it does not support function calls during speculation, so you will get an error if you try to use a `call` or `ret` instruction while speculating.
